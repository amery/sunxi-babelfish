Allwinner Babelfish
-------------------

sunxi-babelfish is a late-stage bootloader for Allwinner-based devices
that are unable to boot a DT-based Linux kernel, mostly because a DT
has not been written for this board yet.

It behaves as a fex-based kernel image, using the fex file to generate
the DT that the kernel will use afterwards.

To do so, it also uses the mach-id passed from the bootloader and the
DTSI that are embedded into the babelfish binary to construct a DTB
that the kernel will be able to use.

This is loosely based on pxa-impedance-matcher from Daniel Mack
(https://github.com/zonque/pxa-impedance-matcher), from a conceptual
point-of-view but some code have been taken directly from it.
